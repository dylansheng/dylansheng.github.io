## Collaborations
I am eager to collaborate with researchers worldwide. My goal is for our joint research outcomes to be accepted and widely shared.
- **[ETH Zurich in Switzerland]** I am working on a paper together with [Furui Cheng (post-doc in ETH)](https://www.furuicheng.tech/), which is targeted for the CHI 2025 (ddl: Sept 2025).
- **[Northwestern University in the USA]** I am collaborating with [Yifang Wang (post-doc in Northwestern)](http://wangyifang.top/) and [Prof. Dashun Wang](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/wang_dashun.aspx) on leveraging visualizations to support the domain of Science of Science.
