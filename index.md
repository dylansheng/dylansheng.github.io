## About Me
Nice to meet you! I am Rui SHENG (盛睿), currently a Ph.D. candidate in HKUST <a href="http://vis.cse.ust.hk/">VisLab</a>, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by <a href="http://huamin.org/">Prof. Huamin Qu</a>. Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree from Wuhan University in 2021 (rank 2/334). 

My research interests lie in data visualization and human-centered design.

I enjoy engaging in communication with others, not only limited to scientific research. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
