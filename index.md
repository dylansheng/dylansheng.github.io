## About Me
Nice to meet you! I am Rui SHENG (盛睿), currently a Ph.D. candidate in HKUST <a href="http://vis.cse.ust.hk/">VisLab</a>, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by <a href="http://huamin.org/">Prof. Huamin Qu</a>. Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree from Wuhan University in 2021 (rank 2/334). 

My research interests lie in data visualization, human AI collaboration and decision making, in particular focusing on how to leverage visual analytics to support sequential decision making in crucial sectors such as healthcare and e-learning.

I enjoy engaging in communication with others, not only limited to scientific research. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

## Research Interests

- **Data Visualization:** I have a passion for developing visual analytics systems that empower decision makers to make more efficient and informed choices.
- **Human AI Collaboration:** I have a keen interest in studying the synergistic collaboration between humans and AI, with a particular focus on exploring how data visualization can serve as a bridge between the two.
- **Decision making:** I specifically focus on sequential decision making in crucial sectors, such as healthcare and e-learning.
