## About Me
Nice to meet you! I am Rui SHENG (ÁõõÁùø), currently a Ph.D. candidate in HKUST <a href="http://vis.cse.ust.hk/">VisLab</a>, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by <a href="http://huamin.org/">Prof. Huamin Qu</a>. Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree from Wuhan University in 2021 (rank 2/334). 

My research interests lie in data visualization, human-AI collaboration, and decision-making, in particular focusing on how to leverage visual analytics to support decision-making in crucial sectors such as healthcare, science, and e-learning.

I enjoy engaging in communication with others, not only limited to scientific research. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

## Research Interests

- **Data Visualization:** I have a passion for developing visual analytics systems that empower decision-makers to make more efficient and informed choices.
- **Human AI Collaboration:** I have a keen interest in studying the synergistic collaboration between humans and AI, with a particular focus on exploring how data visualization can serve as a bridge between the two.
- **Decision making:** I specifically focus on sequential decision-making in crucial sectors, such as healthcare and e-learning.
