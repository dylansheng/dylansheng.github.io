## About Me
Nice to meet you! I am Rui SHENG (盛睿), currently a Ph.D. candidate in HKUST <a href="http://vis.cse.ust.hk/">VisLab</a>, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by <a href="http://huamin.org/">Prof. Huamin Qu</a>. Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree from Wuhan University in 2021 (rank 2/334). 

My research interests focus on data visualization and human-AI collaboration, specifically in three key areas. First, I aim to enhance biomedical research by exploring methodologies that assist researchers in conducting more effective and efficient studies. Second, I investigate how human-AI collaboration can improve decision-making and outcomes in medical practice scenarios. Lastly, I am dedicated to developing intelligent tools that facilitate scientific discovery by interdisciplinary researchers.

I enjoy engaging in communication with others, not only limited to scientific research. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. <span style="color:red">I am currently seeking a postdoctoral position starting in the fall of 2026!</span>

## Research Interests

- **Data Visualization:** I have a passion for developing visual analytics systems that empower decision-makers to make more efficient and informed choices.
- **Human AI Collaboration:** I have a keen interest in studying the synergistic collaboration between humans and AI, with a particular focus on exploring how data visualization can serve as a bridge between the two.
- **AI4Science:** I specifically focus on AI4Science, such as biomedicine and chemistry.
